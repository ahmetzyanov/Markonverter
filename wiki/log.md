# Wiki Log

Use this file for short dated entries about durable project decisions, wiki
updates, and non-trivial implementation changes.

- Created the project-local LLM wiki scaffold with a root map, log, and maps
  area.
- Added root agent instructions in `AGENTS.md`, including the rule to follow
  `DESIGN.md` for design work.
- Stabilized Ozon delivery-selector row actions by anchoring controls to
  normalized pickup-point cards, isolating their CSS from Ozon button styles,
  and skipping the Ozon "add address" control.
- Merged saved pickup-point management into the price rows: removed the separate
  `Points` toggle, show detected Ozon candidates only when unsaved, and avoid
  per-row pending badges in the Ozon delivery selector.
